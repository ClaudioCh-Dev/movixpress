- Vehicle inventory with image storage using Cloudinary
- Rental creation, management, and tracking
- Automatic penalty calculation
- User authentication and authorization (ADMIN, WORKER)
- Document type configuration (invoice, receipt, etc.)
- Company configuration and settings module
- Secure login using Spring Security

---

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot (Security, JPA, Validation)
- MySQL
- Cloudinary
- Bootstrap
- Lombok

---

## Installation and Execution (Using Docker Compose)

To run the application and the database in an isolated and pre-configured way, use Docker Compose

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ClaudioCh-Dev/movixpress.git
   cd movixpress
   ```
2. Configure Environment Variables:  
   The project requires Cloudinary credentials. See the Environment Configuration section for the .env file details
3. Build and Run with Docker Compose:  
   This command builds the Spring Boot application image and spins up the movixpress-app and movixpress-db containers
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Environment Configuration

The project includes an example environment file used to configure database access and Cloudinary credentials.

File: `.env.example`

Copy the file and rename it to:

```bash
.env
```

Fill your Cloudinary credentials:

```properties
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

The `.env` file is ignored by Git and must not be committed.

## Database Initialization

The MySQL database is automatically initialized when launching Docker Compose.

- **Database Name:** movixpress
- **SQL Scripts:** The structure and initial data are located in the new directory:

```bash
/database/
    └── 01-schema.sql (Table Structure)
    └── 02-data.sql   (Initial Data)
```
